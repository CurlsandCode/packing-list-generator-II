# Travel Packing List Generator
Flatiron school Rails Final Project

Travel Packing List Generator

This is a Rails application that allows users to create accounts and add information about their trips and generate packing lists.  The Models included are:

  User - has many trips and has many categories through trips
  Category - has many trips and has many items through trips
  Trip - belongs to a user, belongs to a category, and has many items through a joins table
  Item - has many trips through a joins table

The main page before logging in gives the user the option of Sign In, Sign Up or Sign In With Facebook.  All pages have a home button in the nav bar.

After signing in, the home page displays all of a user's packing lists and gives the user the option of viewing a list, adding a new list or viewing all lists of a particular category.

When the user adds (or edits) a trip the inputs are validated with appropriate messaging.  The user can select from their previous categories or add a new on.  The user can also select from previous items they have taken on trips of the same category.  Thus skis would not be displayed on a beach trip as an option.  All trip components are easily editable and items can be removed.
